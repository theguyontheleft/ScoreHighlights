ScoreHighlights
===============

James Dagres
DESCRIPTION:
=============
Application to display the score and schedule of sports games from selected sports. This application 
is a draft idea of an app that would display scores and schedules of recent sports events. I used HTTML get and pulled JSON data from my ESPN developers key. 
Furthermore, I parsed the data and used abstraction to display events for seven selectable sports. Unfortunately ESPN doesn’t give a parameter for the score of the competitors, I will implement that whenever I get the chance. This code is a draft of the app idea, and is more of a base for anyone that would like to create an app to display scores and sports events.
